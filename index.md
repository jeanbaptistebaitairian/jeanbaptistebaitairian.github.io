# About me

I am a **PhD student** since April 1, 2023 in the HeKA team at **INRIA** (*Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du numérique*), PariSanté Campus, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France and at **Sanofi R&D**, Chilly-Mazarin, France.

The goal of my thesis, called **‘Quantitative Bias Analysis and Model Misspecification in Causal Inference’**, is to assess and potentially develop methodologies that quantitatively evaluate the potential bias due to database insufficiencies and departure from classical hypotheses needed to apply causal inference methods, a domain known as *‘Quantitative Bias Assessment’*.

My supervisor and co-supervior from INRIA are Ms. Agathe GUILLOUX and Ms. Sandrine KATSAHIAN, and I am also supervised by Mr. Bernard SEBASTIEN from Sanofi R&D.
